## Data Visualization & Analysis System

This project is a high-performance desktop application developed in **Java 21**, designed to streamline the process of analyzing and visualizing complex CSV datasets. By leveraging **JavaFX**, the system provides a responsive environment for converting raw data into actionable graphical insights.

### Technical Overview

* **Modular Architecture**: Implemented a "Launcher" design pattern to bypass restrictive module-path checks, ensuring stable deployment across different environments.
* **Data Processing**: Features a robust CSV parsing engine capable of handling large datasets for real-time analysis.
* **Visualization Suite**: Support for multiple chart types, including Bar, Line, Scatter, and Pie charts, with integrated data filtering and aggregation logic.
* **Custom UI Engine**: Built with FXML and external CSS to maintain a separation of concerns between application logic and user interface design.

### Core Technologies

* **Language**: Java 21
* **Framework**: JavaFX
* **Build Automation**: Maven
* **Deployment**: Shaded/Uber JAR for standalone execution
